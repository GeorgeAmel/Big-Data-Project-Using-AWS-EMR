# Big-Data-Project-Using-AWS-EMR

Big Data Processing Pipeline using AWS EMR

A robust, distributed data analysis pipeline designed to process and analyze large-scale datasets. This project demonstrates the orchestration of high-velocity data clusters to derive actionable insights using industry-standard distributed computing frameworks.
## Core Objectives

Scalable Processing: Handle massive datasets that exceed the memory capacity of single-node systems.

Distributed Compute: Leverage AWS EMR to partition tasks across a cluster of EC2 instances.

Optimized Workflows: Utilize Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark for high-speed data transformation and analysis.
